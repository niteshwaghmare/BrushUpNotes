# IntroductionðŸŽƒ  

Python is a cross-platform programming language, which means that it can run on multiple platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and has even been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines. It is free and open-source.

Even though most of today's Linux and Mac have Python pre-installed in it, the version might be out-of-date. So, it is always a good idea to install the most current version.

### Keywords

We cannot use a keyword as a [variable](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/variables-datatypes) name, [function](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function) name or any other identifier. They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.

|   `False`    |    `await`     |    `else`     |    `import`    |    `pass`    |
| :----------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :------------: | :----------: |
|  **`None`**  |  **`break`**   | **`except`**  |    **`in`**    | **`raise`**  |
|  **`True`**  |  **`class`**   | **`finally`** |    **`is`**    | **`return`** |
|  **`and`**   | **`continue`** |   **`for`**   |  **`lambda`**  |  **`try`**   |
|   **`as`**   |   **`def`**    |  **`from`**   | **`nonlocal`** | **`while`**  |
| **`assert`** |   **`del`**    | **`global`**  |   **`not`**    |  **`with`**  |
| **`async`**  |   **`elif`**   |   **`if`**    |    **`or`**    | **`yield`**  |

### Identifiers

An identifier is a name given to entities like class, functions, variables, etc. It helps to differentiate one entity from another.

1. Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase **(a to z)** or uppercase **(A to Z)** or digits **(0 to 9)** or an underscore `_`. Names like `myClass`, `var_1` and `print_this_to_screen`, all are valid example.

2. An identifier cannot start with a digit. `1variable` is invalid, but `variable1` is a valid name.

3. Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.

   ```
   global = 1
   ```

   Output

   ```
     File "<interactive input>", line 1
       global = 1
              ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax
   ```

4. We cannot use special symbols like **!, @, #, $, %** etc. in our identifier.

   ```
   a@ = 0
   ```

   Output

   ```
     File "<interactive input>", line 1
       a@ = 0
        ^
   SyntaxError: invalid syntax
   ```

5. An identifier can be of any length.

### Statement

```python
a = 10

# Multi line statement
a = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
    4 + 5 + 6 + \
    7 + 8 + 9
  
colors = ['red',
          'blue',
          'green']

# Multi statement in single line
a = 1; b = 2; c = 3;
```

### Comments

```python
# Single line comment	

"""This is also a
perfect example of
multi-line comments"""
```

### Variable

A variable is a named location used to store data in the memory. It is helpful to think of variables as a container that holds data that can be changed later in the program.

You can think of variables as a bag to store books in it and that book can be replaced at any time.

```
number = 10
number = 1.1
```

Initially, the value of number was 10. Later, it was changed to 1.1.

**Note**: In Python, we don't actually assign values to the variables. Instead, Python gives the reference of the object(value) to the variable.

**Example**

```python
a, b, c = 5, 3.2, "Hello"

print (a)			# Output: 5
print (b)			# Output: 3.2
print (c)			# Output: Hello

# Assign same value to all variable
a, b, c = "same"


```

### Constant

A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed later.

#### Assigning value to constant in Python

In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned in a module. Here, the module is a new file containing variables, functions, etc which is imported to the main file. Inside the module, constants are written in all capital letters and underscores separating the words.

**Declaring and assigning value to a constant**

Create a **constant.py**:

```python
PI = 3.14
GRAVITY = 9.8
```

Create a **main.py**:

```python
import constant

print(constant.PI)
print(constant.GRAVITY)
```

**Output**

```
3.14
9.8
```

**ðŸ“Œ  Note: ** In reality, we don't use constants in Python. Naming them in all capital letters is a convention to separate them from variables, however, it does not actually prevent reassignment.

### Literals

Literal is a raw data given in a variable or constant. In Python, there are various types of literals they are as follows:

#### Numeric Literals

Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). Numeric literals can belong to 3 different numerical types: `Integer`, `Float`, and `Complex`.

**How to use Numeric literals in Python?**

```python
a = 0b1010 #Binary Literals
b = 100 #Decimal Literal 
c = 0o310 #Octal Literal
d = 0x12c #Hexadecimal Literal

#Float Literal
float_1 = 10.5 
float_2 = 1.5e2

#Complex Literal 
x = 3.14j

print(a, b, c, d)
print(float_1, float_2)
print(x, x.imag, x.real)
```

**Output**

```
10 100 200 300
10.5 150.0
3.14j 3.14 0.0
```

In the above program,

- We assigned integer literals into different variables. Here, a is binary literal, b is a decimal literal, c is an octal literal and d is a hexadecimal literal.
- When we print the variables, all the literals are converted into decimal values.
- 10.5 and 1.5e2 are floating-point literals. 1.5e2 is expressed with exponential and is equivalent to 1.5 * 102.
- We assigned a complex literal i.e 3.14j in variable x. Then we use **imaginary** literal (x.imag) and **real** literal (x.real) to create imaginary and real parts of complex numbers.

------

#### String literals

A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotes. We can use both single, double, or triple quotes for a string. And, a character literal is a single character surrounded by single or double quotes.

**How to use string literals in Python?**

```
strings = "This is Python"
char = "C"
multiline_str = """This is a multiline string with more than one line code."""
unicode = u"\u00dcnic\u00f6de"
raw_str = r"raw \n string"

print(strings)
print(char)
print(multiline_str)
print(unicode)
print(raw_str)
```

**Output**

```
This is Python
C
This is a multiline string with more than one line code.
ÃœnicÃ¶de
raw \n string
```

In the above program, This is Python is a string literal and C is a character literal.

The value in triple-quotes `"""` assigned to the multiline_str is a multi-line string literal.

The string u"\u00dcnic\u00f6de" is a Unicode literal which supports characters other than English. In this case, \u00dc represents `Ãœ` and \u00f6 represents `Ã¶`.

r"raw \n string" is a raw string literal.

------

#### Boolean literals

A Boolean literal can have any of the two values: `True` or `False`.

**How to use boolean literals in Python?**

```
x = (1 == True)
y = (1 == False)
a = True + 4
b = False + 10

print("x is", x)
print("y is", y)
print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)
```

**Output**

```
x is True
y is False
a: 5
b: 10
```

In the above program, we use boolean literal `True` and `False`. In Python, `True` represents the value as 1 and `False` as 0. The value of x is `True` because 1 is equal to `True`. And, the value of y is `False` because 1 is not equal to `False`.

Similarly, we can use the `True` and `False` in numeric expressions as the value. The value of a is 5 because we add `True` which has a value of 1 with 4. Similarly, b is 10 because we add the `False` having value of 0 with 10.

------

#### Special literals

Python contains one special literal i.e. `None`. We use it to specify that the field has not been created.

**How to use special literals in Python?**

```
drink = "Available"
food = None

def menu(x):
    if x == drink:
        print(drink)
    else:
        print(food)

menu(drink)
menu(food)
```

**Output**

```
Available
None
```

In the above program, we define a `menu` function. Inside `menu`, when we set the argument as `drink` then, it displays `Available`. And, when the argument is `food`, it displays `None`.

------

#### Literal Collections

There are four different literal collections List literals, Tuple literals, Dict literals, and Set literals.

**How to use literals collections in Python?**

```
fruits = ["apple", "mango", "orange"] #list
numbers = (1, 2, 3) #tuple
alphabets = {'a':'apple', 'b':'ball', 'c':'cat'} #dictionary
vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i' , 'o', 'u'} #set

print(fruits)
print(numbers)
print(alphabets)
print(vowels)
```

**Output**

```
['apple', 'mango', 'orange']
(1, 2, 3)
{'a': 'apple', 'b': 'ball', 'c': 'cat'}
{'e', 'a', 'o', 'i', 'u'}
```

In the above program, we created a list of fruits, a tuple of numbers, a dictionary dict having values with keys designated to each value and a set of vowels.

## Docstring

Python docstrings (documentation strings) are the [string](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/string) literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module.

**Example**

```python
def double(num):
    """Function to double the value"""
    return 2*num
print(double.__doc__)
```

**Output**

```
Function to double the value
```

**Docstring for built-in-function**

```python
print(print.__doc__)
```

**Output**

```
print(value, ..., sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.
Optional keyword arguments:
file:  a file-like object (stream); defaults to the current sys.stdout.
sep:   string inserted between values, default a space.
end:   string appended after the last value, default a newline.
flush: whether to forcibly flush the stream.
```

## Data Types

```python
a = 5
print(a, "is of type", type(a))

a = 2.0
print(a, "is of type", type(a))

a = 1+2j
print(a, "is complex number?", isinstance(1+2j,complex))
```

**Output**

```
5 is of type <class 'int'>
2.0 is of type <class 'float'>
(1+2j) is complex number? True
```

### List

```python
a = [5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40]

# a[2] = 15
print("a[2] = ", a[2])

# a[0:3] = [5, 10, 15]
print("a[0:3] = ", a[0:3])

# a[5:] = [30, 35, 40]
print("a[5:] = ", a[5:])
```

#### **Create list**

```python
# empty list
my_list = []

# list of integers
my_list = [1, 2, 3]

# list with mixed data types
my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.4]

# nested list
my_list = ["mouse", [8, 4, 6], ['a']]
```

#### **Access elements from list**

```python
# List indexing

my_list = ['p', 'r', 'o', 'b', 'e']

# Output: p
print(my_list[0])

# Output: o
print(my_list[2])

# Output: e
print(my_list[4])

# Nested List 
n_list = ["Happy", [2, 0, 1, 5]]

# Nested indexing
# Output: a
print(n_list[0][1])
# Output: 5
print(n_list[1][3])

# Error! Only integer can be used for indexing
print(my_list[4.0])
```

#### Negative indexing

Python allows negative indexing for its sequences. The index of -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the second last item and so on.

```python
# Negative indexing in lists
my_list = ['p','r','o','b','e']

print(my_list[-1])

print(my_list[-5])
```

When we run the above program, we will get the following output:

```
e
p
```

#### Slice lists in Python

We can access a range of items in a list by using the slicing operator `:`(colon).

```python
# List slicing in Python

my_list = ['p','r','o','g','r','a','m','i','z']

# elements 3rd to 5th
print(my_list[2:5])

# elements beginning to 4th
print(my_list[:-5])

# elements 6th to end
print(my_list[5:])

# elements beginning to end
print(my_list[:])
```

**Output**

```
['o', 'g', 'r']
['p', 'r', 'o', 'g']
['a', 'm', 'i', 'z']
['p', 'r', 'o', 'g', 'r', 'a', 'm', 'i', 'z']
```

Slicing can be best visualized by considering the index to be between the elements as shown below. So if we want to access a range, we need two indices that will slice that portion from the list.

#### How to change elements to a list?

Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed unlike [string](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/string) or [tuple](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tuple).

We can use the assignment operator (`=`) to change an item or a range of items.

```python
# Correcting mistake values in a list
odd = [2, 4, 6, 8]

# change the 1st item    
odd[0] = 1            

print(odd)

# change 2nd to 4th items
odd[1:4] = [3, 5, 7]  

print(odd)                   
```

**Output**

```
[1, 4, 6, 8]
[1, 3, 5, 7]
```

#### Add Elements

```python
odd = [1, 3, 5]
# add one item
odd.append(7)

print(odd)

# add several items using extend
odd.extend([9, 11, 13])

print(odd)

even = [2, 4, 6, 8]
print(even + [10, 12, 14])

print(["re"] * 3)


```

**Output**

```
[1, 3, 5, 7]
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14]
['re', 're', 're']
```

pow2 = [2 ** x for x in range(10)]
print(pow2)
```

### Tuple

```python
# Different types of tuples

# Empty tuple
my_tuple = ()
print(my_tuple)

# Tuple having integers
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)

# tuple with mixed datatypes
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
print(my_tuple)

# nested tuple
my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
print(my_tuple)
```

**Output**

```
()
(1, 2, 3)
(1, 'Hello', 3.4)
('mouse', [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
```

#### Advantages of Tuple over List

Since tuples are quite similar to lists, both of them are used in similar situations. However, there are certain advantages of implementing a tuple over a list. Below listed are some of the main advantages:

- We generally use tuples for heterogeneous (different) data types and lists for homogeneous (similar) data types.
- Since tuples are immutable, iterating through a tuple is faster than with list. So there is a slight performance boost.
- Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as a key for a dictionary. With lists, this is not possible.
- If you have data that doesn't change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected.

### String

[String](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/string) is sequence of Unicode characters. We can use single quotes or double quotes to represent strings. Multi-line strings can be denoted using triple quotes, `'''` or `"""`.

##### Access characters in a string?

```python
#Accessing string characters in Python
str = 'programiz'
print('str = ', str)

#first character
print('str[0] = ', str[0])

#last character
print('str[-1] = ', str[-1])

#slicing 2nd to 5th character
print('str[1:5] = ', str[1:5])

#slicing 6th to 2nd last character
print('str[5:-2] = ', str[5:-2])
```

##### Iterating Through a string

```python
# Iterating through a string
count = 0
for letter in 'Hello World':
    if(letter == 'l'):
        count += 1
print(count,'letters found')
```

##### String Membership Test

We can test if a substring exists within a string or not, using the keyword `in`.

```
>>> 'a' in 'program'
True
>>> 'at' not in 'battle'
False
```

Here is a list of all the **escape sequences** supported by Python.

| Escape Sequence | Description                         |
| :-------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| \newline        | Backslash and newline ignored       |
| \\              | Backslash                           |
| \'              | Single quote                        |
| \"              | Double quote                        |
| \a              | ASCII Bell                          |
| \b              | ASCII Backspace                     |
| \f              | ASCII Formfeed                      |
| \n              | ASCII Linefeed                      |
| \r              | ASCII Carriage Return               |
| \t              | ASCII Horizontal Tab                |
| \v              | ASCII Vertical Tab                  |
| \ooo            | Character with octal value ooo      |
| \xHH            | Character with hexadecimal value HH |

**Note:** There are many string build in operations we can do.

### Sets

A set is an unordered collection of items. Every set element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (cannot be changed).

However, a set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it.

Sets can also be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference, etc.

##### Creating sets

```python
# Different types of sets in Python
# set of integers
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)

# set of mixed datatypes
my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}
print(my_set)

# Distinguish set and dictionary while creating empty set

# initialize a with {}
a = {}

# Output: <class 'dict'>
print(type(a))

# initialize a with set()
a = set()

# Output: <class 'set'>
print(type(a))
```

**Output**

```
{1, 2, 3}
{1.0, (1, 2, 3), 'Hello'}
```

##### Modifying a set in Python

Sets are mutable. However, since they are unordered, indexing has no meaning.

We cannot access or change an element of a set using indexing or slicing. Set data type does not support it.

We can add a single element using the `add()` method, and multiple elements using the `update()` method. The `update()` method can take [tuples](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tuple), lists, [strings](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/string) or other sets as its argument. In all cases, duplicates are avoided.

```python
# initialize my_set
my_set = {1, 3}
print(my_set)

# if you uncomment line 9,
# you will get an error
# TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing

# my_set[0]

# add an element
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(2)
print(my_set)

# add multiple elements
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set.update([2, 3, 4])
print(my_set)

# add list and set
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
my_set.update([4, 5], {1, 6, 8})
print(my_set)

```

##### Removing elements 

A particular item can be removed from a set using the methods `discard()` and `remove()`.

The only difference between the two is that the `discard()` function leaves a set unchanged if the element is not present in the set. On the other hand, the `remove()` function will raise an error in such a condition (if element is not present in the set).

The following example will illustrate this.

```python
# Difference between discard() and remove()

# initialize my_set
my_set = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
print(my_set)

# discard an element
# Output: {1, 3, 5, 6}
my_set.discard(4)
print(my_set)

# remove an element
# Output: {1, 3, 5}
my_set.remove(6)
print(my_set)

# discard an element
# not present in my_set
# Output: {1, 3, 5}
my_set.discard(2)
print(my_set)

# remove an element
# not present in my_set
# you will get an error.
# Output: KeyError

my_set.remove(2)
```

Similarly, we can remove and return an item using the `pop()` method.

Since set is an unordered data type, there is no way of determining which item will be popped. It is completely arbitrary.

We can also remove all the items from a set using the `clear()` method.

```python
# initialize my_set
# Output: set of unique elements
my_set = set("HelloWorld")
print(my_set)

# pop an element
# Output: random element
print(my_set.pop())

# pop another element
my_set.pop()
print(my_set)

# clear my_set
# Output: set()
my_set.clear()
print(my_set)

print(my_set)
```

**Output**

```
{'H', 'l', 'r', 'W', 'o', 'd', 'e'}
H
{'r', 'W', 'o', 'd', 'e'}
set()
```

#### Set Operations

##### Union

![python-union](/Users/niteshwaghmare/Documents/Workspace/Notes/img/python-union.png)

```python
# Set union method
# initialize A and B
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# use | operator
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
print(A | B)

print(A.union(B))
```

##### Intersection

![python intersection](/Users/niteshwaghmare/Documents/Workspace/Notes/img/python intersection.png)

```python
# Intersection of sets
# initialize A and B
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# use & operator
# Output: {4, 5}
print(A & B)


# use intersection function on A
>>> A.intersection(B)
{4, 5}

# use intersection function on B
>>> B.intersection(A)
{4, 5}
```

##### Difference

![python difference](/Users/niteshwaghmare/Documents/Workspace/Notes/img/python difference.png)

```python
# Difference of two sets
# initialize A and B
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# use - operator on A
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
print(A - B)

# use difference function on A
>>> A.difference(B)
{1, 2, 3}

# use - operator on B
>>> B - A
{8, 6, 7}

# use difference function on B
>>> B.difference(A)
{8, 6, 7}
```

##### Symmetric Difference

![python set](/Users/niteshwaghmare/Documents/Workspace/Notes/img/python set.png)

Symmetric Difference of A and B is a set of elements in A and B but not in both (excluding the intersection).

Symmetric difference is performed using `^` operator. Same can be accomplished using the method `symmetric_difference()`.

```python
# Symmetric difference of two sets
# initialize A and B
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}

# use ^ operator
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
print(A ^ B)

# use symmetric_difference function on A
>>> A.symmetric_difference(B)
{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}

# use symmetric_difference function on B
>>> B.symmetric_difference(A)
{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}
```

#### Frozenset

Frozenset is a new class that has the characteristics of a set, but its elements cannot be changed once assigned. While tuples are immutable lists, frozensets are immutable sets.

Sets being mutable are unhashable, so they can't be used as dictionary keys. On the other hand, frozensets are hashable and can be used as keys to a dictionary.

Frozensets can be created using the [frozenset()](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/methods/built-in/frozenset) function.

This data type supports methods like `copy()`, `difference()`, `intersection()`, `isdisjoint()`, `issubset()`, `issuperset()`, `symmetric_difference()` and `union()`. Being immutable, it does not have methods that add or remove elements.

```python
# Frozensets
# initialize A and B
A = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
B = frozenset([3, 4, 5, 6])

>>> A.isdisjoint(B)
False
>>> A.difference(B)
frozenset({1, 2})
>>> A | B
frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})
>>> A.add(3)
...
AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```

### Dictionary

Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. Each item of a dictionary has a `key/value` pair.

Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.

```python
# empty dictionary
my_dict = {}

# dictionary with integer keys
my_dict = {1: 'apple', 2: 'ball'}

# dictionary with mixed keys
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 1: [2, 4, 3]}

# using dict()
my_dict = dict({1:'apple', 2:'ball'})

# from sequence having each item as a pair
my_dict = dict([(1,'apple'), (2,'ball')])

# get vs [] for retrieving elements
my_dict = {'name': 'Jack', 'age': 26}

# Output: Jack
print(my_dict['name'])

# Output: 26
print(my_dict.get('age'))

# Trying to access keys which doesn't exist throws error
# Output None
print(my_dict.get('address'))

# KeyError
print(my_dict['address'])
```

##### Adding elements

```python
# Changing and adding Dictionary Elements
my_dict = {'name': 'Jack', 'age': 26}

# update value
my_dict['age'] = 27

#Output: {'age': 27, 'name': 'Jack'}
print(my_dict)

# add item
my_dict['address'] = 'Downtown'

# Output: {'address': 'Downtown', 'age': 27, 'name': 'Jack'}
print(my_dict)
```

##### Removing elements from Dictionary

We can remove a particular item in a dictionary by using the `pop()` method. This method removes an item with the provided `key` and returns the `value`.

The `popitem()` method can be used to remove and return an arbitrary `(key, value)` item pair from the dictionary. All the items can be removed at once, using the `clear()` method.

We can also use the `del` keyword to remove individual items or the entire dictionary itself.

```python
# Removing elements from a dictionary

# create a dictionary
squares = {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}

# remove a particular item, returns its value
# Output: 16
print(squares.pop(4))

# Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 5: 25}
print(squares)

# remove an arbitrary item, return (key,value)
# Output: (5, 25)
print(squares.popitem())

# Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
print(squares)

# remove all items
squares.clear()

# Output: {}
print(squares)

# delete the dictionary itself
del squares

# Throws Error
print(squares)
```

**Output**

```
16
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 5: 25}
(5, 25)
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}
{}
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 30, in <module>
    print(squares)
NameError: name 'squares' is not defined
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

| Operator | Meaning                                                      | Example                  |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| +        | Add two operands or unary plus                               | x + y+ 2                 |
| -        | Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus          | x - y- 2                 |
| *        | Multiply two operands                                        | x * y                    |
| /        | Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float) | x / y                    |
| %        | Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right | x % y (remainder of x/y) |
| //       | Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line | x // y                   |
| **       | Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right         | x**y (x to the power y)  |

### Comparison operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values. It returns either `True` or `False` according to the condition.

| Operator | Meaning                                                      | Example |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| >        | Greater than - True if left operand is greater than the right | x > y   |
| <        | Less than - True if left operand is less than the right      | x < y   |
| ==       | Equal to - True if both operands are equal                   | x == y  |
| !=       | Not equal to - True if operands are not equal                | x != y  |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right | x >= y  |
| <=       | Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right | x <= y  |

**Example**

```python
x = 10
y = 12

# Output: x > y is False
print('x > y is',x>y)

# Output: x < y is True
print('x < y is',x<y)

# Output: x == y is False
print('x == y is',x==y)

# Output: x != y is True
print('x != y is',x!=y)

# Output: x >= y is False
print('x >= y is',x>=y)

# Output: x <= y is True
print('x <= y is',x<=y)
```

### Logical operators

| Operator | Meaning                                            | Example |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :------ |
| and      | True if both the operands are true                 | x and y |
| or       | True if either of the operands is true             | x or y  |
| not      | True if operand is false (complements the operand) | not x   |

```python
x = True
y = False

print('x and y is',x and y)

print('x or y is',x or y)

print('not x is',not x)
```

**Output**

```
x and y is False
x or y is True
not x is False
```

### Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. They operate bit by bit, hence the name.

For example, 2 is `10` in binary and 7 is `111`.

**In the table below:** Let x = 10 (`0000 1010` in binary) and y = 4 (`0000 0100` in binary)

| Operator | Meaning             | Example                   |
| :------- | :------------------ | :------------------------ |
| &        | Bitwise AND         | x & y = 0 (`0000 0000`)   |
| \|       | Bitwise OR          | x \| y = 14 (`0000 1110`) |
| ~        | Bitwise NOT         | ~x = -11 (`1111 0101`)    |
| ^        | Bitwise XOR         | x ^ y = 14 (`0000 1110`)  |
| >>       | Bitwise right shift | x >> 2 = 2 (`0000 0010`)  |
| <<       | Bitwise left shift  | x << 2 = 40 (`0010 1000`) |

------

### Assignment operators

Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.

`a = 5` is a simple assignment operator that assigns the value 5 on the right to the variable a on the left.

There are various compound operators in Python like `a += 5` that adds to the variable and later assigns the same. It is equivalent to `a = a + 5`.

| Operator | Example | Equivalent to |
| :------- | :------ | :------------ |
| =        | x = 5   | x = 5         |
| +=       | x += 5  | x = x + 5     |
| -=       | x -= 5  | x = x - 5     |
| *=       | x *= 5  | x = x * 5     |
| /=       | x /= 5  | x = x / 5     |
| %=       | x %= 5  | x = x % 5     |
| //=      | x //= 5 | x = x // 5    |
| **=      | x **= 5 | x = x ** 5    |
| &=       | x &= 5  | x = x & 5     |
| \|=      | x \|= 5 | x = x \| 5    |
| ^=       | x ^= 5  | x = x ^ 5     |
| >>=      | x >>= 5 | x = x >> 5    |
| <<=      | x <<= 5 | x = x << 5    |

------

### Special operators

Python language offers some special types of operators like the identity operator or the membership operator. They are described below with examples.

#### Identity operators

`is` and `is not` are the identity operators in Python. They are used to check if two values (or variables) are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical.

| Operator | Meaning                                                      | Example       |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| is       | True if the operands are identical (refer to the same object) | x is True     |
| is not   | True if the operands are not identical (do not refer to the same object) | x is not True |

**Example**

```python
x1 = 5
y1 = 5
x2 = 'Hello'
y2 = 'Hello'
x3 = [1,2,3]
y3 = [1,2,3]

# Output: False
print(x1 is not y1)

# Output: True
print(x2 is y2)

# Output: False
print(x3 is y3)
```

**Output**

```
False
True
False
```

Here, we see that x1 and y1 are integers of the same values, so they are equal as well as identical. Same is the case with x2 and y2 (strings).

But x3 and y3 are lists. They are equal but not identical. It is because the interpreter locates them separately in memory although they are equal.

------

#### Membership operators

`in` and `not in` are the membership operators in Python. They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence ([string](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/string), [list](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list), [tuple](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/tuple), [set](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/set) and [dictionary](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/dictionary)).

In a dictionary we can only test for presence of key, not the value.

| Operator | Meaning                                             | Example    |
| :------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| in       | True if value/variable is found in the sequence     | 5 in x     |
| not in   | True if value/variable is not found in the sequence | 5 not in x |

**Example**

```python
x = 'Hello world'
y = {1:'a',2:'b'}

# Output: True
print('H' in x)

# Output: True
print('hello' not in x)

# Output: True
print(1 in y)

# Output: False
print('a' in y)
```

**Output**

```
True
True
True
False
```

Here, `'H'` is in x but `'hello'` is not present in x (remember, Python is case sensitive). Similarly, `1` is key and `'a'` is the value in dictionary y. Hence, `'a' in y` returns `False`.

# Control flow

## if...else Statement

```python
if expression:
  statement(s)
elif expression:
  statement(s)
elif expression:
  statement(s)
else:
  statement(s)
	
```

## For loop

```python
# For loop
for val in sequence:
  statement(s)

```

### The range() function

We can generate a sequence of numbers using `range()` function. `range(10)` will generate numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers).

We can also define the start, stop and step size as `range(start, stop,step_size)`. step_size defaults to 1 if not provided.

The `range` object is "lazy" in a sense because it doesn't generate every number that it "contains" when we create it. However, it is not an iterator since it supports `in`, `len` and `__getitem__` operations.

This function does not store all the values in memory; it would be inefficient. So it remembers the start, stop, step size and generates the next number on the go.

To force this function to output all the items, we can use the function `list()`.

The following example will clarify this.

```python
print(range(10))

print(list(range(10)))

print(list(range(2, 8)))

print(list(range(2, 20, 3)))
```

**Output**

```
range(0, 10)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
[2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17]
```

#### For loop with else

```python
for i in digits:
    print(i)
else:
    print("No items left.")
```

## While loop

```python
while expression:
	Body of while
  

while expression:
  Body of while
else:
  # while loop's else part runs if no break occurs and the condition is false.
```

##  break statement

The `break` statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.

If the `break` statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop), the `break` statement will terminate the innermost loop.

### Syntax of break

```
break
```

### Flowchart of break

![Flowchart of break statement in Python](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/flowchart-break-statement.jpg)

The working of break statement in [for loop](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/for-loop) and [while loop](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/while-loop) is shown below.

![How the break statement works in Python](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/how-break-statement-works.jpg)

**Example**

```python
# Use of break statement inside the loop

for val in "string":
    if val == "i":
        break
    print(val)

print("The end")
```

**Output**

```
s
t
r
The end
```

## continue statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.

### Syntax of Continue

```
continue
```

### Flowchart of continue 

![Flowchart of continue statement in Python](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/continue-statement-flowchart.jpg)

The working of continue statement in for and while loop is shown below.

![How continue statement works in python](https://cdn.programiz.com/sites/tutorial2program/files/how-continue-statment-works.jpg)

### Example: Python continue

```python
# Program to show the use of continue statement inside loops

for val in "string":
    if val == "i":
        continue
    print(val)

print("The end")
```

**Output**

```
s
t
r
n
g
The end
```

This program is same as the above example except the `break` statement has been replaced with `continue`.

We continue with the loop, if the string is i, not executing the rest of the block. Hence, we see in our output that all the letters except i gets printed.

## What is pass statement in Python?

In Python programming, the `pass` statement is a null statement. The difference between a [comment](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/statement-indentation-comments) and a `pass` statement in Python is that while the interpreter ignores a comment entirely, `pass` is not ignored.

However, nothing happens when the pass is executed. It results in no operation (NOP).

**Example**

```python
class Animals:
  pass

for item in list:
  pass

def eat():
  pass
```

# Functions

A function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.

Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.

Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable.

**Syntax**

```python
def functionName(parameters):
  """Optional documentation string (docstring) to describe what the function does."""
  statement(s)
  

# Function with return value
def functionName(parameters):
  statement(s)
  return parameters
```

### Python Arbitrary Arguments

Sometimes, we do not know in advance the number of arguments that will be passed into a function. Python allows us to handle this kind of situation through function calls with an arbitrary number of arguments.

In the function definition, we use an asterisk (*) before the parameter name to denote this kind of argument. Here is an example.

```
def greet(*names):
    """This function greets all
    the person in the names tuple."""

    # names is a tuple with arguments
    for name in names:
        print("Hello", name)


greet("Monica", "Luke", "Steve", "John")
```

**Output**

```
Hello Monica
Hello Luke
Hello Steve
Hello John
```

Here, we have called the function with multiple arguments. These arguments get wrapped up into a tuple before being passed into the function. Inside the function, we use a `for` loop to retrieve all the arguments back.

## Recursion

Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.

A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors facing each other. Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.

Factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 6 (denoted as 6!) is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.

**Example**

```python
def factorial(x):
    """This is a recursive function
    to find the factorial of an integer"""

    if x == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return (x * factorial(x-1))


num = 3
print("The factorial of", num, "is", factorial(num))
```

When we call this function with a positive integer, it will recursively call itself by decreasing the number.

Each function multiplies the number with the factorial of the number below it until it is equal to one. This recursive call can be explained in the following steps.

```
factorial(3)          # 1st call with 3
3 * factorial(2)      # 2nd call with 2
3 * 2 * factorial(1)  # 3rd call with 1
3 * 2 * 1             # return from 3rd call as number=1
3 * 2                 # return from 2nd call
6                     # return from 1st call
```

### Advantages of Recursion

1. Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
2. A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.
3. Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.

------

### Disadvantages of Recursion

1. Sometimes the logic behind recursion is hard to follow through.
2. Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time.
3. Recursive functions are hard to debug.



## Anonymous/Lambda Function

In Python, an anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name.

While normal functions are defined using the `def` keyword in Python, anonymous functions are defined using the `lambda` keyword.

Hence, anonymous functions are also called lambda functions.

**Syntax**

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

Lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. Lambda functions can be used wherever function objects are required.

**Example**

```python
# Program to show the use of lambda functions
double = lambda x: x * 2

# Output: 10
print(double(5))
```

In the above program, `lambda x: x * 2` is the lambda function. Here x is the argument and `x * 2` is the expression that gets evaluated and returned.

This function has no name. It returns a function object which is assigned to the identifier `double`. We can now call it as a normal function. The statement

```
double = lambda x: x * 2
```

is nearly the same as:

```
def double(x):
   return x * 2
```

### Use of Lambda Function in python

We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time.

In Python, we generally use it as an argument to a higher-order function (a function that takes in other functions as [arguments](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function-argument)). Lambda functions are used along with built-in functions like `filter()`, `map()` etc.

### Example use with filter()

The `filter()` function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments.

The function is called with all the items in the list and a new list is returned which contains items for which the function evaluates to `True`.

Here is an example use of `filter()` function to filter out only even numbers from a list.

```python
# Program to filter out only the even items from a list
my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]

new_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0) , my_list))

print(new_list)
```

**Output**

```
[4, 6, 8, 12]
```

### Example use with map()

The `map()` function in Python takes in a function and a list.

The function is called with all the items in the list and a new list is returned which contains items returned by that function for each item.

Here is an example use of `map()` function to double all the items in a list.

```python
# Program to double each item in a list using map()

my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]

new_list = list(map(lambda x: x * 2 , my_list))

print(new_list)
```

**Output**

```
[2, 10, 8, 12, 16, 22, 6, 24]
```

## Global, Local and Nonlocal variables

### Global variable

```python
x = "global"

def foo():
    print("x inside:", x)


foo()
print("x outside:", x)
```

**Output**

```
x inside: global
x outside: global
```

**What if you want to change the value of x inside a function?**

```python
x = "global"

def foo():
    x = x * 2
    print(x)

foo()
```

**Output**

```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'x' referenced before assignment
```

### Local variable

```python
def foo():
    y = "local"


foo()
print(y)
```

**Output**

```
NameError: name 'y' is not defined
```

The output shows an error because we are trying to access a local variable y in a global scope whereas the local variable only works inside `foo()` or local scope.

### Global and local variable

How to use global variables and local variables in the same code.

```python
x = "global "

def foo():
    global x
    y = "local"
    x = x * 2
    print(x)
    print(y)

foo()
```

**Output**

```
global global 
local
```

In the above code, we declare x as a global and y as a local variable in the `foo()`. Then, we use multiplication operator `*` to modify the global variable x and we print both x and y.

After calling the `foo()`, the value of x becomes `global global` because we used the `x * 2` to print two times `global`. After that, we print the value of local variable y i.e `local`.

**Global variable and Local variable with same name**

```python
x = 5

def foo():
    x = 10
    print("local x:", x)


foo()
print("global x:", x)
```

**Output**

```
local x: 10
global x: 5
```

In the above code, we used the same name x for both global variable and local variable. We get a different result when we print the same variable because the variable is declared in both scopes, i.e. the local scope inside `foo()` and global scope outside `foo()`.

When we print the variable inside `foo()` it outputs `local x: 10`. This is called the local scope of the variable.

Similarly, when we print the variable outside the `foo()`, it outputs global x: 5. This is called the global scope of the variable.

### Nonlocal Variables

Nonlocal variables are used in nested functions whose local scope is not defined. This means that the variable can be neither in the local nor the global scope.

Let's see an example of how a global variable is created in Python.

We use `nonlocal` keywords to create nonlocal variables.

**Create a nonlocal variable**

```
def outer():
    x = "local"

    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = "nonlocal"
        print("inner:", x)

    inner()
    print("outer:", x)


outer()
```

**Output**

```
inner: nonlocal
outer: nonlocal
```

In the above code, there is a nested `inner()` function. We use `nonlocal` keywords to create a nonlocal variable. The `inner()` function is defined in the scope of another function `outer()`.

**Note** : If we change the value of a nonlocal variable, the changes appear in the local variable.

## Global Keyword

In Python, `global` keyword allows you to modify the variable outside of the current scope. It is used to create a global variable and make changes to the variable in a local context.

### Rules of global Keyword

The basic rules for `global` keyword in Python are:

- When we create a variable inside a function, it is local by default.
- When we define a variable outside of a function, it is global by default. You don't have to use `global` keyword.
- We use `global` keyword to read and write a global variable inside a function.
- Use of `global` keyword outside a function has no effect.

# Modules

Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions.

A file containing Python code, for example: `example.py`, is called a module, and its module name would be `example`.

We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.

We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definitions into different programs.

Let us create a module. Type the following and save it as `example.py`.

```python
# Python Module example

def add(a, b):
   """This program adds two
   numbers and return the result"""

   result = a + b
   return result
```

Here, we have defined a [function](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/function) `add()` inside a module named `example`. The function takes in two numbers and returns their sum.

------

## How to import modules in Python?

We can import the definitions inside a module to another module or the interactive interpreter in Python.

We use the `import` keyword to do this. To import our previously defined module `example`, we type the following in the Python prompt.

```python
>>> import example
```

â€‹	This does not import the names of the functions defined in `example` directly in the current symbol table. It only imports the module name `example` there.

Using the module name we can access the function using the dot `.` operator. For example:

```python
>>> example.add(4,5.5)
9.5
```

Python has tons of standard modules. You can check out the full list of [Python standard modules](http://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html) and their use cases. These files are in the Lib directory inside the location where you installed Python.

Standard modules can be imported the same way as we import our user-defined modules.

There are various ways to import modules. They are listed below..

### Import 

```python
import math

print(math.pi)
```

### Import with rename

```python
import math as m
print(m.pi)
```

### from...import statement

We can import specific names from a module without importing the module as a whole. Here is an example.

```python
from math import pi, e

# Output: 3.141592653589793
print(pi)

# Output: 2.718281828459045
print(e)
```

### import all names

```python
from math import *

# Output: 3.141592653589793
print(pi)
```

**Note: ** Importing everything with the asterisk (*) symbol is not a good programming practice. This can lead to duplicate definitions for an identifier. It also hampers the readability of our code.

### Module Search Path

While importing a module, Python looks at several places. Interpreter first looks for a built-in module. Then(if built-in module not found), Python looks into a list of directories defined in `sys.path`. The search is in this order.

- The current directory.
- `PYTHONPATH` (an environment variable with a list of directories).
- The installation-dependent default directory.

# Package

As our application program grows larger in size with a lot of modules, we place similar modules in one package and different modules in different packages. This makes a project (program) easy to manage and conceptually clear.

Similarly, as a directory can contain subdirectories and files, a Python package can have sub-packages and modules.

A directory must contain a file named `__init__.py` in order for Python to consider it as a package. This file can be left empty but we generally place the initialization code for that package in this file.

![python package](/Users/niteshwaghmare/Documents/Workspace/Notes/img/python package.png)

```python
from Game.Level.start import select_difficulty
select_difficulty(2)
```

# Files and  IO

## Open File

```python
f = open('read.txt')
```

We can specify the mode while opening a file. In mode, we specify whether we want to read `r`, write `w` or append `a` to the file. We can also specify if we want to open the file in text mode or binary mode.

The default is reading in text mode. In this mode, we get strings when reading from the file.

On the other hand, binary mode returns bytes and this is the mode to be used when dealing with non-text files like images or executable files.

| Mode | Description                                                  |
| :--: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `r`  | Opens a file for reading. (default)                          |
| `w`  | Opens a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists. |
| `x`  | Opens a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails. |
| `a`  | Opens a file for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist. |
| `t`  | Opens in text mode. (default)                                |
| `b`  | Opens in binary mode.                                        |
| `+`  | Opens a file for updating (reading and writing)              |

```python
f = open("test.txt")      # equivalent to 'r' or 'rt'
f = open("test.txt",'w')  # write in text mode
f = open("img.bmp",'r+b') # read and write in binary mode
```

Moreover, the default encoding is platform dependent. In windows, it is `cp1252` but `utf-8` in Linux.

So, we must not also rely on the default encoding or else our code will behave differently in different platforms.

Hence, when working with files in text mode, it is highly recommended to specify the encoding type.

```python
f = open("test.txt", mode='r', encoding='utf-8')
```

## Close File

```python
f = open("test.txt", mode='r', encoding='utf-8')

f.close()
```

**Example**

```python
# This is safer way to work with 
try:
   f = open("test.txt", encoding = 'utf-8')
   # perform file operations
finally:
   f.close()
```

This way, we are guaranteeing that the file is properly closed even if an exception is raised that causes program flow to stop.

The best way to close a file is by using the `with` statement. This ensures that the file is closed when the block inside the `with` statement is exited.

We don't need to explicitly call the `close()` method. It is done internally.

```python
with open("test.txt", encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
   # perform file operations
```

## Write file

```python
with open("test.txt",'w',encoding = 'utf-8') as f:
   f.write("my first file\n")
   f.write("This file\n\n")
   f.write("contains three lines\n")
```

This program will create a new file named `test.txt` in the current directory if it does not exist. If it does exist, it is overwritten.

We must include the newline characters ourselves to distinguish the different lines.

## Read file

```python
f = open('text.txt', r)
f.read()
"""
This is my first file
This file
contains three lines
"""

# Second method
for line in f:
  print(line, end = '')
  
"""
This is my first file
This file
contains three lines
"""

print(f.readline())
# Output: This is my first file\n
```

## File methods

There are various methods available with the file object. Some of them have been used in the above examples.

Here is the complete list of methods in text mode with a brief description:

|            Method            | Description                                                  |
| :--------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|           close()            | Closes an opened file. It has no effect if the file is already closed. |
|           detach()           | Separates the underlying binary buffer from the `TextIOBase` and returns it. |
|           fileno()           | Returns an integer number (file descriptor) of the file.     |
|           flush()            | Flushes the write buffer of the file stream.                 |
|           isatty()           | Returns `True` if the file stream is interactive.            |
|           read(n)            | Reads at most n characters from the file. Reads till end of file if it is negative or `None`. |
|          readable()          | Returns `True` if the file stream can be read from.          |
|        readline(n=-1)        | Reads and returns one line from the file. Reads in at most n bytes if specified. |
|       readlines(n=-1)        | Reads and returns a list of lines from the file. Reads in at most n bytes/characters if specified. |
| seek(offset,from=`SEEK_SET`) | Changes the file position to offset bytes, in reference to from (start, current, end). |
|          seekable()          | Returns `True` if the file stream supports random access.    |
|            tell()            | Returns the current file location.                           |
|    truncate(size=`None`)     | Resizes the file stream to size bytes. If size is not specified, resizes to current location. |
|          writable()          | Returns `True` if the file stream can be written to.         |
|           write(s)           | Writes the string s to the file and returns the number of characters written. |
|      writelines(lines)       | Writes a list of lines to the file.                          |

# Exception

We can make certain mistakes while writing a program that lead to errors when we try to run it. A python program terminates as soon as it encounters an unhandled error. These errors can be broadly classified into two classes:

1. Syntax errors
2. Logical errors (Exceptions)

## Syntax Errors

Error caused by not following the proper structure (syntax) of the language is called **syntax error** or **parsing error**.

## Logical Error

Errors that occur at runtime (after passing the syntax test) are called **exceptions** or **logical errors**.

For instance, they occur when we try to open a file(for reading) that does not exist (`FileNotFoundError`), try to divide a number by zero (`ZeroDivisionError`), or try to import a module that does not exist (`ImportError`).

```python
print(dir(locals()['__builtins__']))
```

## Built-in Exceptions



Illegal operations can raise exceptions. There are plenty of built-in exceptions in Python that are raised when corresponding errors occur. We can view all the built-in exceptions using the built-in `local()` function as follows:

```
print(dir(locals()['__builtins__']))
```

`locals()['__builtins__']` will return a module of built-in exceptions, functions, and attributes. `dir` allows us to list these attributes as strings.

Some of the common built-in exceptions in Python programming along with the error that cause them are listed below:

|        Exception        | Cause of Error                                               |
| :---------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
|    `AssertionError`     | Raised when an `assert` statement fails.                     |
|    `AttributeError`     | Raised when attribute assignment or reference fails.         |
|       `EOFError`        | Raised when the `input()` function hits end-of-file condition. |
|  `FloatingPointError`   | Raised when a floating point operation fails.                |
|     `GeneratorExit`     | Raise when a generator's `close()` method is called.         |
|      `ImportError`      | Raised when the imported module is not found.                |
|      `IndexError`       | Raised when the index of a sequence is out of range.         |
|       `KeyError`        | Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.              |
|   `KeyboardInterrupt`   | Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (`Ctrl+C` or `Delete`). |
|      `MemoryError`      | Raised when an operation runs out of memory.                 |
|       `NameError`       | Raised when a variable is not found in local or global scope. |
|  `NotImplementedError`  | Raised by abstract methods.                                  |
|        `OSError`        | Raised when system operation causes system related error.    |
|     `OverflowError`     | Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented. |
|    `ReferenceError`     | Raised when a weak reference proxy is used to access a garbage collected referent. |
|     `RuntimeError`      | Raised when an error does not fall under any other category. |
|     `StopIteration`     | Raised by `next()` function to indicate that there is no further item to be returned by iterator. |
|      `SyntaxError`      | Raised by parser when syntax error is encountered.           |

## Handling an exception

If you have some *suspicious* code that may raise an exception, you can defend your program by placing the suspicious code in a **try:** block. After the try: block, include an **except:** statement, followed by a block of code which handles the problem as elegantly as possible.

**Syntax**

```
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
except ExceptionI:
   If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block.
except ExceptionII:
   If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. 
```

Here are few important points about the above-mentioned syntax âˆ’

- A single try statement can have multiple except statements. This is useful when the try block contains statements that may throw different types of exceptions.
- You can also provide a generic except clause, which handles any exception.
- After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause. The code in the else-block executes if the code in the try: block does not raise an exception.
- The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection.

**Example**

```python
try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
except IOError:
   print "Error: can\'t find file or read data"
else:
   print "Written content in the file successfully"
   fh.close()
```

This produces the following result âˆ’

```
Written content in the file successfully
```

**Example**

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

try:
   fh = open("testfile", "r")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
except IOError:
   print "Error: can\'t find file or read data"
else:
   print "Written content in the file successfully"
```

## The *except* Clause with No Exceptions

```
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
except:
   If there is any exception, then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. 
```

This kind of a **try-except** statement catches all the exceptions that occur. Using this kind of try-except statement is not considered a good programming practice though, because it catches all exceptions but does not make the programmer identify the root cause of the problem that may occur.

## The *except* Clause with Multiple Exceptions

You can also use the same *except* statement to handle multiple exceptions as follows âˆ’

```
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
except(Exception1[, Exception2[,...ExceptionN]]]):
   If there is any exception from the given exception list, 
   then execute this block.
   ......................
else:
   If there is no exception then execute this block. 
```

## The try-finally Clause

You can use a **finally:** block along with a **try:** block. The finally block is a place to put any code that must execute, whether the try-block raised an exception or not. The syntax of the try-finally statement is this âˆ’

```python
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
   Due to any exception, this may be skipped.
finally:
   This would always be executed.
   ......................
```

You cannot use *else* clause as well along with a finally clause.

**Example**

```python
try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
finally:
   print "Error: can\'t find file or read data"
```

If you do not have permission to open the file in writing mode, then this will produce the following result âˆ’

```
Error: can't find file or read data
```

**Example 2**

```python
try:
   fh = open("testfile", "w")
   try:
      fh.write("This is my test file for exception handling!!")
   finally:
      print "Going to close the file"
      fh.close()
except IOError:
   print "Error: can\'t find file or read data"
```

When an exception is thrown in the *try* block, the execution immediately passes to the *finally* block. After all the statements in the *finally* block are executed, the exception is raised again and is handled in the *except* statements if present in the next higher layer of the *try-except* statement.

## Argument of an Exception

An exception can have an *argument*, which is a value that gives additional information about the problem. The contents of the argument vary by exception. You capture an exception's argument by supplying a variable in the except clause as follows âˆ’

```python
try:
   You do your operations here;
   ......................
except ExceptionType, Argument:
   You can print value of Argument here...
```

If you write the code to handle a single exception, you can have a variable follow the name of the exception in the except statement. If you are trapping multiple exceptions, you can have a variable follow the tuple of the exception.

This variable receives the value of the exception mostly containing the cause of the exception. The variable can receive a single value or multiple values in the form of a tuple. This tuple usually contains the error string, the error number, and an error location.

**Example**

Following is an example for a single exception 

```python
# Define a function here.
def temp_convert(var):
   try:
      return int(var)
   except ValueError, Argument:
      print "The argument does not contain numbers\n", Argument

# Call above function here.
temp_convert("xyz");
```

**Output**

```
The argument does not contain numbers
invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'xyz'
```

## Raising an Exceptions

You can raise exceptions in several ways by using the raise statement. The general syntax for the **raise** statement is as follows.

**Syntax**

```
raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]
```

Here, *Exception* is the type of exception (for example, NameError) and *argument* is a value for the exception argument. The argument is optional; if not supplied, the exception argument is None.

The final argument, traceback, is also optional (and rarely used in practice), and if present, is the traceback object used for the exception.

**Example**

An exception can be a string, a class or an object. Most of the exceptions that the Python core raises are classes, with an argument that is an instance of the class. Defining new exceptions is quite easy and can be done as follows âˆ’

```python
def functionName( level ):
   if level < 1:
      raise "Invalid level!", level
      # The code below to this would not be executed
      # if we raise the exception
```

**Note:** In order to catch an exception, an "except" clause must refer to the same exception thrown either class object or simple string. For example, to capture above exception, we must write the except clause as follows âˆ’

```
try:
   Business Logic here...
except "Invalid level!":
   Exception handling here...
else:
   Rest of the code here...
```

## User-Defined Exceptions

Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by deriving classes from the standard built-in exceptions.

Here is an example related to *RuntimeError*. Here, a class is created that is subclassed from *RuntimeError*. This is useful when you need to display more specific information when an exception is caught.

In the try block, the user-defined exception is raised and caught in the except block. The variable e is used to create an instance of the class *Networkerror*.

```python
class Networkerror(RuntimeError):
   def __init__(self, arg):
      self.args = arg
```

So once you defined above class, you can raise the exception as follows âˆ’

```python
try:
   raise Networkerror("Bad hostname")
except Networkerror,e:
   print e.args
```
